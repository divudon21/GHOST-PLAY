/**
 * The sleeve's own colours, upside down and reduced to a mesh, for the player
 * to stand on.
 *
 * This is the other approach to a colour backdrop: no quantiser at all. The
 * sleeve is averaged into a [MESH_GRID] square of means; the row against the
 * seam is kept in place, and everything below it is flipped and then rotated
 * sideways — see [rotatedBelowSeam]. What the backdrop holds is the cover's own
 * colours, roughly in the cover's own proportions (nine-tenths black stays
 * nine-tenths black) and with each cell's neighbours exactly what they were in
 * the source, but not lined up in the cover's own *position*: a flip on its own
 * reads as a reflection on any cover with real structure to it — a face, a
 * horizon, a logo — however coarse the grid, because the layout still lines up
 * column for column with what's on screen above it. The rotation is what
 * actually breaks that column-for-column match; the coarseness just keeps any
 * one cell from being recognisable on its own.
 *
 * Held as a tiny bitmap rather than a list of colours because that is exactly
 * what the hardware wants: one [DrawScope.drawImage] with bilinear filtering
 * interpolates the whole mesh in the sampler. A blob per cell would be
 * thirty-six full-screen radial gradients.
 *
 * Ported from BitChord (`ui/player/ArtworkMeshBackdrop.kt`). The only change is
 * the source of the pixels: BitChord reads Coil's decoded artwork by URL, this
 * reads the [Bitmap] the app's own artwork loader already produced.
